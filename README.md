### The challenge

This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM. Perfect for anyone who has learned the basics of JavaScript!
The challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I recently started with javascript and learned the fundamentals of DOM. And this was my first project using the concepts of DOM, there are so many things to discover to write more efficient code and I'm so much enjoying this process.
